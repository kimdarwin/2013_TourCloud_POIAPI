 Doesn't Mean Anything - Alicia Keys

 Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care but if I’m seeing my dreams and you aren’t there ’cause it’s over that just wont be fair, darling.
I’d rather be a poor woman living on the street, no food to eat ’cause I don’t want no pie if I have to cry’cause it’s over when you said goodbye
 All at once I had it all but it doesn’t mean anything now that you’re gone from above, seems I had it allbut it doesn’t mean anything since you’re gone
 Now I see myself through different eyes it’s no surprise but being alone would make you realize, when it’s over all in love is fairI shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda
All at onceI had it allbut it doesn’t mean anythingnow that you’re gone from above,seems I had it all but it doesn’t mean anything since you’re gone
 I know I pushed you away what can I do that would save our love take these material things they don’t mean nothingits you that I want
 All at once I had it all but it doesn’t mean anything now that you’re gone from above, seems I had it all but it doesn’t mean anything since you’re gone
